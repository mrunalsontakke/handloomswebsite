                Handlooms in Odisha have ushered in exquisite fabrics, breathtaking in their range. Yet they are durable and economical. The mastery of the weavers has especially touched sylvan heights in tassar silk. The tassar cooperatives produce the finest quality
                of yarn, the popularity of which is testified by its brilliance, glaze and texture. The attention to details from silkworm cultivation to silk weaving combine centuries of experience and modern know-how, for creating silk ties and sarees
                that harmonise the delicate feel with a soothing blend of colours and elegance, exquisite but comfortable. The textiles have an individuality of their own. Bold and unusual patterns, vibrant yet subtle blend of colours, unique tie and
                die effects and a luxuriant texture characterize them. The State is famous for its silk ikat weaves, an intricate process (bandha) in which warp and weft threads are first tied and then dyed, to produce the designed pattern on the loom
                while weaving. Typical design motifs include rows of birds, animals, fish, seashells, rudraksha beads and temple spires. The most popular and flagship item of the tie and dye textile of Odisha is the saree. Some typical varieties of Odisha,
                sarees are Khanduas, Saktapada, Tarabaliand Bichitrapuri, to name a few, made both in cotton and silk. However, the weavers also delve into other items like bed covers, dress materials, handkerchiefs, lungi and gamuchha (towel). The tribal
                people of the State also excel in producing textiles of myriad hues using vegetable dyes.

                It has been noted that lately the popularity of Kuchai silk, a traditional Indian fabric, is growing, leading to increasing demand overseas. Kuchai silk is produced chiefly in the Kharsawan-Kuchai region of Jharkhand and the state believes that the current
                scenario will open up several opportunities for this industry. The trade is expected to be healthy, especially after the State attained ‘organic silk’ registration for kuchai around October 2008. Kuchai silk uses no chemical in its production
                and is original and organic produce that does not affect the environment, either. Insiders revealed that kuchai silk manufacturers have already received sizeable orders, and are expecting more. Recognizing this, the industry decided to
                double its silk production for 2008 from the 150 tons last year. Experts stress that the EU, as well as the US, are potential markets for kuchai silk, even amidst the financial crunch. Calculations show that sales would increase by almost
                40-50 per cent. According to official statistics, 3,300 farmers have been registered for the production of 30 million organic silk cocoons that would be bred in Kharsawan and Seraikela comprising the Kuchai region. Further, there are 2,300
                weavers involved in this mission. Stylists say that the state should promote this skill by encouraging artistic patterns and modern designs.

                        Handloom products of Bengal have a rich tradition. The heritage of our master weavers and artisans are now blended with new technological designs and threads to produce a wide variety of products. As an economic trade & industrial activity, the handlooms
                        occupy a place second only to agriculture in providing livelihood to the people. The Government of West Bengal has emphasized the Handloom & Textiles Sector with the announcement of new textile policy and setting up of Commissionerate
                        of Textiles for development, infrastructure support and also improves attraction for investment. West Bengal has a repertoire of textiles in a variety of designs and manufactured by different techniques. The textile heritage of
                        Bengal has many chapters… many tales… about singularity in diversity. Some of the most beautiful textiles of West Bengal have been chosen for this blog keeping in mind the uniqueness of the weaves, texture, and quality and I hope
                        that Bengal’s fabrics, spun and woven by hand, would soon be on shop shelves nationwide!
